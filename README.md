This is a repository for the PUMS data used in "Practical Data Science in R", 
published by Manning Publishers.

The authors of the book also publish the data. This is just where I keep my copy
which has some of the intermediate files I like to use, scripts etc. If you are
looking for the PUMS data, look at https://github.com/WinVector/zmPDSwR which
is where the authors keep their stuff. That's the gold standard.
